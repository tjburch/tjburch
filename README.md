### Tyler James Burch

I'm an analyst working in Baseball Research and Development for the Boston Red Sox.

Previously:

- Postdoc @ Argonne National Laboratory - particle physics simulation for the Aurora Supercomputer, uncertainty quantification for neural networks
- PhD @ Northern Illinois University - research on the ATLAS experiment on the LHC at CERN. Higgs boson pair production, machine learning for photon identification

My programming interests are primarily in data analysis, machine learning, and [Bayesian] statistics. My other personal hobbies include  music, baking, and running.

Feel free to reach out, and be sure to read some of my work on my blog.
