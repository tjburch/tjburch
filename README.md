### Tyler James Burch

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Argonne National Laboratory, working on physics applications for the upcoming Aurora Supercomputer. In my Ph.D. I worked on the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at CERN, studying the Higgs Boson.

My other interests are sports analytics, specifically baseball, as well as music, baking, and running.

Feel free to reach out, and be sure to read some of my work on my blog.
